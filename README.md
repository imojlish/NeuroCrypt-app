This project presents NeuroCrypt, a secure web application that enhances symmetric encryption by integrating artificial intelligence into the AES-128 key generation process. Instead of relying on traditional pseudo-random number generators, the system uses a lightweight neural network to generate entropy-rich, unpredictable encryption keys, thereby improving resistance to brute-force attacks and predictable patterns. 
Built with Streamlit, the application enables users to securely log in, encrypt and decrypt messages, and maintain detailed activity logs for accountability and traceability. The platform emphasizes practical cybersecurity by combining AI-driven cryptographic enhancements with user authentication and traceable audit trails. 
This approach addresses potential weaknesses in standard AES key generation, especially in constrained or resource-limited environments, and aligns with emerging research that supports the application of AI in strengthening encryption systems and anomaly detection. The overall goal is to demonstrate a scalable, intelligent, and innovative encryption solution that reflects the future direction of secure digital communication across various online platforms.
